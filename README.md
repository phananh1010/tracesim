# tracesim
Trace simulation framework for head prediction

## File exaplantion

visualize_result.ipynb is the main entry to get the final simuation results. This file contains code to generate figures for our journal paper.
test_simulator is the previous main entry containing all figures, including the Viewport Perceived Quality (1 boxplot and 1 . Results are migrated into visualize_result.ipynb

tracesim_simulation_v2.ipynb contains the whole simulation process. Data can be regenerated from 4G log using this ipynb

test_simulator_lib.py contains the most pyplot function to plot the graph. visualization in the visualize_result.ipynb use most function from this file.
